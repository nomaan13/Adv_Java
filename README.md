JDBC-Based College Management System

This project demonstrates a simple JDBC-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing college records. It follows a structured MVC architecture with the following components:

Connection: Establishes a database connection using JDBC.
Controller: Handles user requests and interacts with the DAO layer.
DAO (Data Access Object): Implements CRUD operations (Insert, Update, Delete) for college records.
DTO (Data Transfer Object) - College: Represents a college entity with fields: id (int), name (String), email (String), address (String), and type (String).
